<h2>My Web Design Experience</h2>
<p>I don't have that much firsthand experience with web programming and development. Before this semester, I only took two classes on the subject and I had not ever independently learned about it.</p>
<h2>What I hope to learn</h2>
<p>I would like to gain a solid grasp on developer tools for web design and programming. I feel mostly comfortable with HTML and CSS, so I would like to continue to sharpen those skills in addition to gaining practical knowledge about designing functional complex websites.</p>
<h2>My future with web design</h2>
<p>I'm kind of pivoting towards becoming a DBA so I don't know how much I'll use these skills on the job, but I still think they're extremely useful to have in my arsenal in the modern age.</p>
